# Syllabusy

Syllabusy is a web app that allows users to upload their syllabi for ai to parse and summarize. Key details, dates, and information is extracted, which is then aggregated and displayed to the user.

## What are all the planned features?

-   Upload pdfs and syllabi
-   Data and information display through a neat dashboard
-   Login and preservation of user data

# Contribution

To contribute to Syllabusy, you must have git, Node.js, Node Package Manager (npm), and Python (as well as pip, which should most likely be automatically installed) for the frontend and backend to install the relevant dependencies.

## Frontend Contributions

First, clone the repository into your own project.

`git clone https://github.com/qZheng/syllabus-decoder`

Next, navigate to the frontend root folder and install the dependencies.

`npm install`

From there, you can start developing.

`npm run dev`

## Backend Contributions

-   We are still working on finishing and hosting the backend (wip)
